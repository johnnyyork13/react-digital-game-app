A mock digital game purchasing app that displays a chosen game's information. 

Features include an AI powered search bar that autofills game based on input, as well as a random game option that randomly selects a game in RAWG's database. 

This application also provides a wishlist to users, however I have not implemented permanent storage - effectively making it a showcase component only. (Although I may revisit this project in the future and add persisting storage either through the localStorage API or through Mongo).

This project is only intended to practice React concepts like useParams, useLocation, and React routes.

All data and images on this application are derived from the RAWG gaming API.
